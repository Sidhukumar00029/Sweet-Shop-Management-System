My AI Usage

AI Tools Used
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)

How I Used AI
- Used ChatGPT to understand the project requirements and break them into backend, testing, and frontend tasks.
- Used AI assistance to generate boilerplate code for Spring Boot controllers, services, repositories, and React components.
- Used AI to debug failing unit tests, integration tests, and resolve HTTP status mismatches.
- Used AI to understand REST API best practices and proper HTTP response codes.
- Used AI for frontend routing, service integration, and component structure in React.

Reflection
Using AI significantly improved my productivity and helped me debug issues faster.  
I ensured that I understood every piece of generated code and manually verified logic, tests, and outputs.  
AI acted as a support tool, not a replacement for my own understanding and decision-making.
